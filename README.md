# HipChat Connect - Modern Express Starter

This project is an (unofficial) fork of the example HipChat/Express addon provided by Atlassian. The primary differences are:

1. Upgraded to [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/guide/migrating-4.html) (from 3)
2. ES2015 transpilation (via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) configured out of the box for code that runs under node.js
3. ES2015 transpilation + bundling with [rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/) for code that runs in HipChat webviews

## Requirements

1. Must be using a version of `node.js` >= 5.0.0 (You can technically go lower, but you'll need to change the babel presets installed)

## Usage

Still a WIP.
